## 📦 Installation

`@dt-dds/react` uses CSS-IN-JS behind the scenes. You'll also need to add Emotion as a project dependency.

```bash
yarn add @dt-dds/react @emotion/css @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

## 🔨 Usage

Import the DT-DDS global styles in the root component.

```tsx
import '@dt-dds/react/index.css';
```

And wrap your code in a `ThemeProvider` component to make it available to all components.

```tsx
import { Provider as ThemeProvider, theme } from '@dt-dds/react';

function App() {
  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    ...
  <ThemeProvider/>
}
```

We provide a default Daimler Truck theme, available under the package `react-core/themes`
